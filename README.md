## Where you start?

A good place to start with Data Storytelling is to build a notebook and try out some ideas.
This notebook explores ideas to do with height, weight and age in baseball:  https://github.com/noahgift/Python-MLOps-Cookbook/blob/main/Baseball_Predictions_Export_Model.ipynb


### Where did this dataset come from and what can this tell us?


*Abstract*

We employ a unique dataset of Major League Baseball (MLB) players – a select, healthy population – to examine trends in height, weight, and body mass in birth cohorts from 1869 to 1983. Over that 115-year time period, U.S. born MLB players have gained, on average, approximately 3 in. (7.6 cm) in height and 27.0 lb (12.2 kg) in weight, which has contributed a 1.6-unit increase in the body mass index. Where comparable data are available, U.S. born MLB players are about 2.0 in. (5.1 cm) taller and 20.0 lb (9.1 kg) heavier but substantially less obese than males in the general U.S. population. But both groups exhibit similar height and weight trends; the majority of height and weight gains take place in cohorts that were born prior to World War II, followed by slower gains and occasional declines in height and weight for cohorts born in 1939 and later.

*Abstract*

*Results*: Compared to 20‐year‐old U.S. males, MLB players can expect almost five additional years of life. Height, weight, handedness, and player ratings are unassociated with the risk of death in this population of highly active and successful adults. Career length is inversely associated with the risk of death, likely because those who play longer gain additional incomes, physical fitness, and training.

*Conclusions:* Our results indicate improvements in life expectancies with time for all age groups and indicate possible improvements in longevity in the general U.S. population.

### What else can we investigate?

* Age and Weight Gain
* Muscle mass and longevity
* Wealth and life expectency
* [Intermittent Fasting and Healthy Body Weight](https://noahgift.com/articles/datascience-meets-intermittent-fasting/)
* Is BMI too crude of a tool to measure health and longevity?
* Does Obesity lead to poor outcomes in Pandemics i.e. Covid-19?
